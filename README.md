# Portfolio 2019

Resume supplement to showcase my knowledge and development life cycle.
Currently lacking in content and design, but provides a barebones showcase of Vue being used as a single-page application with a responsive design.

This branch features changes to better support development on an Android platform, specifically via Termux. In particular, Cypress for e2e testing is not supported, and previewing live changes from the development server requires the server and client to be on the same local network.

## System Requirements

- **Node** 10.16.x
- **NPM** 6.9.x
- **Python2** 2.7.x
- **make** latest
- **g++** latest

Easiest way to install Node/NPM is to use NVM.

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install 10.16
nvm use 10.16
```

### Installing on Windows / Mac OS / Linux

```bash
cd ./vue-template
```

Proceed to **Project Setup**.

### Installing on Android

Install `node-gyp` via NPM first:

```bash
cd ./vue-template
npm install node-gyp
```

Then open `common.gypi` with a text editor such as Nano:

```bash
nano ~/.node-gyp/YOUR_INSTALLED_VERSION/include/node/common.gypi
```

Search for the first occurrence of `"android"`, and replace `'-fPIE'` with `'-fPIC'` for both `'cflags'` and `'ldflags'`. Remove the `-pie` flag from `'ldflags'` as well. Search for the second occurrence of `"android"` and repeat the steps above. Save the file, and be sure to `cd` back into the vue-template directory if necessary.

You may now proceed to **Project Setup**.

## Project Setup

```bash
npm run serve
```

### Compile and minify for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Lint and fix files

```bash
npm run lint
```
